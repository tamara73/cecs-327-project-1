Assignment 1: Mini Housing Search Service

Real-Life Applications:

You are asked to build a small version of an online housing search service (similar in spirit to Zillow or a rental search engine).

Users will run a client program to search for available houses/apartments by city and maximum price. Behind that client, there will be:

An Application Server that parses user queries, applies ranking/filtering, and caches recent results.

A Data Server that stores housing data and answers simple data requests.
